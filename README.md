Class Notes
===========
checkout.rb
-----------
Implements the API as described in the problem. Is also completely agnostic to the number of items in the
pricing/item list. So it should handle any arbitrarily small/large list of items and their prices.
item.rb
-------
This class represents the items in the supermarket, keeping track of their prices and bogof or bulk offer status and
prices. Has a full set of setters and getters for the item data. Can be instantiated with any number of arguments 
and does some minor type checking to stop non-numberic values being passed to numberic fields. It also keeps track 
of how many of each item has been scanned bycheckout.rb. This in turn means that .get_price will return the discount
price if an item count exceeds the bulk value if set. Possibly it would be better to move keeping track of an items
scanned total where the instances of each item are created (i.e. pricing_rules).
pricing_rules.rb
----------------
This class instantiates a list of all the items and initialises their prices. At the moment this is the most fragile
piece of code as it just hard sets 3 items and then hard codes the item data. In a production system
with multiple checkouts/clients and maybe multiple users making price and item adjustments I'd envisage the system
would be underpinned by a database. This class would act as an ORM layer; building it's item list on the fly and 
also populating each item's data on the fly. Then we could simply add an admin class alongside checkout.rb which
is capable of adding, deleting and updating items.
